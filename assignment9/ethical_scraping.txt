3.Reflect on why websites use robots.txt and write 2-3 sentences explaining its purpose and how it promotes ethical scraping

Websites use `robots.txt` primarily to communicate their crawling preferences to web robots and automated scripts.
Its purpose is to guide these bots on which parts of the site they should or should not access, helping to prevent 
server overload from aggressive crawling and to keep certain sections private or irrelevant to indexing.
By providing these guidelines, `robots.txt` promotes ethical scraping because it allows website owners to set boundaries;
responsible and ethical scrapers honor these requests, respecting the website's resources and the wishes of its administrators.
Adhering to `robots.txt` is a fundamental aspect of good "netiquette" for automated tools accessing web content.
